HistoryHash class provides a simple API to key-value store that also supports time-travelling.
This means that keep history of every value assigned to a particular key.

Reference:
  - To create new store: store = HistoryHash.new
  - To fetch latest value for a particular key: store.get(:foo)
  - To set a value for a key: store.set(:foo, 42)
  - To fetch a value at a particular time: store.get(:foo, 2)

Constraints:
  - You should specify time within existing boundaries. Use positive Integer numbers at times.
    In case if you try to fetch the value at time that hasn't been assigned yet, we gracefully fallback to the latest value.
